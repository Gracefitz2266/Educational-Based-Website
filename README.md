Group Project - Educational Software System 

In this project we were required to:

1. Elicit a substantial set of software requirements from them in the form of User 
Stories (10 User Stories should be created).
2. The User Stories should then be translated into formal descriptions/models that can be 
used by all project stakeholders, most importantly the developers and testers. These 
models would include a complete set of UML diagrams: Use Case, Sequence Diagram, 
Class Diagram and Architecture Diagram.
3. A mock-up of the user interface should be produced.
4. Additionally, an outline set of System tests that can be used to validate the User 
requirements should be created.
